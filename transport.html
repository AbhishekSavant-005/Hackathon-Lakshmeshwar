            A transport scheme is a plan or system for the movement of people or goods from one place to another. <br>
             It involves various modes of transportation, such as buses, trains, cars, planes, and ships, and may also include infrastructure such as roads, railways, airports, and seaports. <br>

A transport scheme is designed to meet the specific transportation needs of a particular region or community, taking into account factors such as population density, traffic patterns, and economic activity. It may involve the development of new transportation infrastructure, <br>

Transport schemes can have a significant impact on the economy, the environment, and quality of life. A well-designed transport scheme can improve access to jobs, education, and services, reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, and support economic growth. However, poorly designed transport schemes can have negative impacts, <br> 
such as increased traffic congestion, air pollution, and social exclusion. <br>
